Not all changes to KiCad have to large by themselves, and this development highlight aims to showcase smaller improvements made 
so far to the 3D Viewer by a few contributors and are available in the nightly builds.

== Populate Silkscreen and Soldermask Colors from PCBNew board properties
A small quality of life improvement (but appreciated nonetheless üëç), https://gitlab.com/Drinausaur[Fabien Corona] in https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/merge_requests/63[MR#63] added the ability
for the 3D viewer to use the board soldermask and silkscreen colors as defined in PCBNew just like the title of the merge request implies üòÄ

== Plated and Non-Plated Copper pads
A subtle change has been made in 
https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/merge_requests/405[MR#405]  by https://gitlab.com/KammutierSpule[Mario Luzeiro] that affects how copper colors.
The visual difference between plated copper pads and non-plated copper pads will now be visible.

== Model Opacity
A utility feature was added to adjust the opacity of 3D models that can aid in mechanical design previews with a simple slider

== Configurable Raytracing Lighting
Up until now, raytracing used a fixed light source during rendering. 
https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/merge_requests/349[MR#188] by https://gitlab.com/KammutierSpule[Mario Luzeiro] moves the light source configuration to the options dialog that allows easy customization.

== Rendering Performance Improvement
https://gitlab.com/oleg.endo[Oleg Endo] was unhappy with the rendering performance of the 3D viewer which on his system exhibited 
frames per second rendering times as slow as 10 FPS. After his changes in https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/merge_requests/145[MR#145]
rendering speeds may be up to 8x faster as before.

== Lighting improvement with floors
The floor plane object that is optional to add in the 3D Viewer previously cast a shadow onto the bottom side of the board.
https://gitlab.com/burhanemre[Emery Burhan] in https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/merge_requests/170[MR#170] submitted a patch
to disable the casting of shadow by the floor object to give the PCB a more uniform look.

== Configurable View Change Speed
https://gitlab.com/burhanemre[Emery Burhan] in https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/merge_requests/171[MR#171] added the ability to set
an "animation speed" when toggling between board views with hotkeys. 

Now the camera animation speed can be adjusted by a slider which can be found in the options dialog.

The slowest speed of 1 looks like this

The fastest speed of 5 looks like this
