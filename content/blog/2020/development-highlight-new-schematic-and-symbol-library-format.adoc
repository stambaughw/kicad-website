Since KiCad 4.0, work has been progressing to overhaul all the various project
file formats that among many benefits, make them far more human friendly, easier to parse and allow easier addition of new features.

<!--more-->
For example, the schematic file format used to look like this
```
EESchema Schematic File Version 5
EELAYER 33 0
EELAYER END
$Descr A4 11693 8268
encoding utf-8
Sheet 6 8
Title "Video"
Date "Sun 22 Mar 2015"
Rev "2.0B"
Comp "Kicad EDA"
Comment1 ""
$EndDescr
Connection ~ 2500 1800
NoConn ~ 2600 3000
Wire Wire Line
	950  3200 950  3450
Text Label 1250 2200 0    60   ~ 0
ADR[2..6]
```

As part of the transition and eventually the future KiCad 6.0, schematic and symbol library finally
have been transitioned to new file formats and made the default formats.

The schematic file format now looks like this:
```
(kicad_sch (version 20200310) (host eeschema "(5.99.0-1467-g4b4952b09)")

  (page "A3")

  (title_block
    (title "Video")
    (date "Sun 22 Mar 2015")
    (rev "2.0B")
    (company "Kicad EDA")
    (comment 1 "Main sheet")
  )

  (junction (at 375.92 107.95))

  (wire (pts (xy 31.75 49.53) (xy 49.53 49.53)))

  (label "ADR[2..6]" (at 31.75 55.88 0)
      (effects (font (size 1.524 1.524)) (justify left bottom))
  )
)
```

All new schematics and symbol libraries will be created
using the new file formats. All existing schematics will be converted
to the new file format on the first load and all subsequent changes
will be made to the new file format. The old schematic files remain
unchanged and no further changes will be made. It is still a good
idea to make a backup of all existing schematic files just in case
something goes wrong.

There are a few things to be aware of when switching between the 5.1
and development branches:

* Please allow all library symbol rescuing and remapping to complete to
ensure that the library symbols will be saved to the schematic files.
If either of these steps are aborted, saving the schematic will
certainly result in broken symbol links which will require manual
intervention to resolve.

* The symbol library cache is no longer required for the new file
format. Converting back to the legacy file format may result in broken
symbol links so avoid converting between formats. Schematics are now
fully portable without the cache library.

* Version control software users must add the new schematic files
(*.kicad_sch) to ensure change control is maintained.

* In the short term, the ability to save schematics and symbol libraries
to the old file format will be maintained for testing purposes. Once
new schematic and/or symbol library features are added, saving to the
old file format will be deprecated to prevent data loss between format
conversions.

* The new schematic file format fixes a long standing bug when sharing
schematic files between projects. Prior to the new file format,
sharing files between projects in a simple hierarchical design
required the symbol annotation to be maintained in the shared file(s).
This limitation has been removed and the annotation can be changed in
the shared file because annotations for the entire project are saved
in the root schematic file. Root schematics can also be shared by
other projects as well because annotations in hierarchical sheet
schematic files are ignored and are not changed by the project.

If you want to give the board import a spin, simply download the
latest KiCad nightly. Feel free to link:/help/report-an-issue/[report
any issues] you may find.

Thank you for your patience as we work through any issues with the new
file formats. Once the existing feature set is stable, expect to see
new schematic and symbol library features added fairly quickly.

but have not yet been absorbed into the code base's documentation.

If you want to join in on a discussion on this feature, you may find a

NOTE: Both this feature and nightly builds are in development, please
only use them for testing and experimentation
