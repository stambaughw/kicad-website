The KiCad project is proud to announce the latest series 5 stable
release of KiCad.  The 5.0.1 stable version contains critical bug
fixes and other minor improvements since the 5.0.0 release.  It
also includes improved footprint, symbol, and 3D model libraries,
translations, and documentation.  A list of all of the fixed bugs
since the 5.0.0 release can be found on the
link:https://launchpad.net/kicad/5.0/5.0.1[KiCad 5.0.1 milestone page].
This release contains several critical bug fixes so please consider
upgrading as soon as possible.

[WARNING]
Please note that a last minute bug was found in the Eagle schematic
import feature too late to be fixed in this release which is expected
to be fixed in release 5.0.2.  If you need to convert Eagle schematics
you may want to hold off upgrading until 5.0.2.

Version 5.0.1 is made from the
link:https://git.launchpad.net/kicad/log/?h=5.0[lp:kicad/5.0]
branch with some cherry picked changes from the development branch.

KiCad binaries will be available for download for Windows, MacOS, and
Linux are available or will be in the very near future.  See the
link:/download[download page] for guidance.

Thank you to all developers, packagers, librarians, document writers,
translators, and everyone else who helped make this release possible.
