The KiCad project is proud to announce the latest series 5 stable

other minor improvements since the previous release.  It also includes
improved footprint, symbol, and 3D model libraries, translations, and
documentation.

A list of all of the fixed bugs since the 5.1.6 release can be found
on the https://gitlab.com/groups/kicad/code/-/milestones/2[KiCad 5.1.7
milestone page].  This release contains several critical bug fixes so
please consider upgrading as soon as possible.

Version 5.1.7 is made from the
https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/commits/5.1/[5.1] branch with
some cherry picked changes from the development branch.

Packages for Windows, MacOS, and Linux are available or will be
in the very near future.  See the
link:/download[KiCad download page] for guidance.

Thank you to all developers, packagers, librarians, document writers,
translators, and everyone else who helped make this release possible.
