brief = "The contributor must own the rights to share the 3D model"
+++

The goal of the KiCad 3d model library is to provide a free open library of 3d models. This requires certain restrictions regarding contributions with respect to their legal status.

* Users must only submit models for which they own the rights allowing relicensing under the KiCad library licence. 

* In most cases this means they have created the model themselves, either manually designed in a parametric modeling software or via scripting tools.

* Contributing model data designed by a third party complicates licensing issues and is to be avoided. This includes files downloaded from a manufacturers website.
