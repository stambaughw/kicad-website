brief = "Source files for 3D models must be supplied"
+++

The KiCad library maintains a repository for 3D source files at link:https://gitlab.com/kicad/libraries/kicad-packages3D-source[https://gitlab.com/kicad/libraries/kicad-packages3D-source].

The _source files_ used to generate 3D model data must be submitted to this repository when a user contributes 3D model data.

* Source files of 3d models are the native files generated by the 3d modeling software (Example: fcstd for Freecad).

* Source files alternatively are any generator scripts. 
** However scripts found in link:https://github.com/easyw/kicad-3d-models-in-freecad[https://github.com/easyw/kicad-3d-models-in-freecad] do not need to be added to the source repo.

* The source repository directory structure mirrors that of the kicad-packages-3d repository.
